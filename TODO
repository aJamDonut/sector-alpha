Basic principles:
    ☐ Economy
        ☐ Factions are able to trade between themselves
          Every marker participant should be able to adjust their buy and sell 
          threshold using some adaptive strategy (factor-based?).

          ☐ Add trading between facilities
          ☐ Allow facilities to adjust their offer's prices

        ✔ Goods are obtainable by mining or fabrication @started(22-04-04 23:20) @done(22-04-11 21:45) @lasted(6d22h25m58s)
          Every faction has its own set of produced and consumed goods.

            ☐ Rework asteroid fields so they contain multiple resources
              It just doesn't seem realistic or balanced to have only one 
              resource type in the whole asteroid field

        ✔ Storage is limited @done(22-03-17 13:37)
          Prevents throwing resources to production which has no demand yet.

        ✔ Transactions are safe @started(22-03-17 16:04) @done(22-04-04 15:21) @lasted(2w3d22h17m32s)
          Prevents from competing in movement speed.

        ☐ Assymetrical market information
          Factions have limited knowledge about other factions, allowing them to
          make decisions that are locally optimal, but not globally.

        ✔ Transport is not instant @done(22-03-17 13:38)
          Factions have different ships, meaning they vary in terms of storage
          and speed.

        ☐ Save data regarding price/quantity over time
          This will allow player to see how market works. It can also be used
          during development to improve balance.

        ☐ Ships can be constructed
          Along with facility construction it will allow world grow.

        ☐ Facilities can be constructed
          Same as ship constructing.


    ☐ World
        ☐ Lore
            ☐ Factions
              How many? Which ones?
            ☐ Sectors
            ☐ Travel
              FTL? Long-haul sublight? Jump gates?
            ☐ Goods
                ☐ Materials obtained from mining
                ☐ Goods produced in facilities
                ☐ Currency
                  It's way easier to set up Universal Trade Token (UTT)

    ☐ Research and development
        ☐ Technological advancement
          Factions can improve their stats by constantly improving their ships
          and facilities
    ☐ War
       TBD, not in mvp
          

Bugs:
    ✔ Simulation dies after 20 000 seconds @done(22-04-12 02:15)
      It happens, because traders stop delivering commodities to facilities
      which need them. Probably related to Facility.getNeededCommodities,
      Facility.getCommoditiesForSell and Ship.autoTrade

Ideas:
    ☐ Text and script based user input
      Allow player to manually write scripts that are executed server-side to
      automate all tasks.
