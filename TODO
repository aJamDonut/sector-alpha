Basic principles:
    ☐ Economy
        ☐ Factions are able to trade between themselves
          Every marker participant should be able to adjust their buy and sell 
          threshold using some adaptive strategy (factor-based?).

        ☐ Goods are obtainable by mining or fabrication
          Every faction has its own set of produced and consumed goods.

        ☐ Storage is limited
          Prevents throwing resources to production which has no demand yet.

        ☐ Transactions are save
          Prevents from competing in movement speed.

        ☐ Assymetrical market information
          Factions have limited knowledge about other factions, allowing them to
          make decisions that are locally optimal, but not globally.

        ☐ Transport is not instant
          Factions have different ships, meaning they vary in terms of storage
          and speed.

        ☐ Save data regarding price/quantity over time
          This will allow player to see how market works. It can also be used
          during development to improve balance.

    ☐ World
        ☐ Lore
            ☐ Factions
              How many? Which ones?
            ☐ Sectors
            ☐ Travel
              FTL? Long-haul sublight? Jump gates?
            ☐ Goods
                ☐ Materials obtained from mining
                ☐ Goods produced in facilities
                ☐ Currency
                  It's way easier to set up Universal Trade Token (UTT)

    ☐ Research and development
        ☐ Technological advancement
          Factions can improve their stats by constantly improving their ships
          and facilities
    ☐ War
       TBD, not in mvp
          

Ideas:
    ☐ Text and script based user input
      Allow player to manually write scripts that are executed server-side to
      automate all tasks.
